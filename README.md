# Rancher is sorta.. awesome.

Today I wondered if there was a better way than Portainer to launch dockers and stuff and my jaw dropped when I found out and installed Rancher. It's really the most brainless way to manage Docker/Swarm I've found so far. So far I fucked it up only... 3 times. Just enough to write a small bash script to wipe Docker off my dev machine, install it back and then fire up a brand new Rancher installation. Pretty proud of myself.
